## What is a Layer?

A layer added `ggplot()` can be a geom...

- The type of geometric object
- The statistic mapped to that object
- The data set from which to obtain the statistic

... or a position adjustment to the scales

- Changing the axes scale
- Changing the color gradient

## Layer Examples

Plot               Geom              Stat
------------------ ----------------- -----------------
Scatterplot        point             identity
Histogram          bar               bin count
Smoother           line + ribbon     smoother function
Binned Scatterplot rectangle + color 2d bin count

## Piecing Things Together

Want to build a map using NOAA data

- Coordinate system (mapping Long-Lat to X-Y)
- Add layer of state outlines
- Add layer of points for float locations
- Add layers for Oil Rig marker and label
- Adjust the range of x and y scales

## The Result

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=7, warning=FALSE}
ggplot() +
    geom_path(data = states, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) + 
    geom_point(data = floats, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude, colour = callSign)) +   
    geom_point(aes(x, y), shape = "x", size = 5, data = rig) + 
    geom_text(aes(x, y), label = "BP Oil Rig", size = 5, data = rig, hjust = -0.1) + 
    xlim(c(-91, -80)) + 
    ylim(c(22, 32)) + coord_map()
```

<li>Read in the animal.csv data:</li>

```{r}
animal <- read.csv("http://heike.github.io/rwrks/02-r-graphics/data/animal.csv")
```

<li>Plot the location of animal sightings on a map of the region</li>
<li>On this plot, try to color points by class of animal and/or status of animal</li>
</ol>

## `ggplot` is pipeable!

We can pass data as the first argument to `ggplot()`... meaning we can **pipe** to it!

## Tidyverse FTW

```{r, message=FALSE, out.height="250px"}
library(tidyverse)
data(baseball, package="plyr")

baseball %>%
  filter(ab > 0) %>% #only players that have ever had an at bat
  group_by(year) %>%
  mutate(ba = h/ab,
         mean_ba = mean(h/ab)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(year, ba), alpha = .1) +
  geom_line(aes(year, mean_ba), colour = "blue")
```

## French fries

During a ten week sensory experiment, 12 individuals were asked to assess taste of french fries on several scales (how potato-y, buttery, grassy, rancid, paint-y do the fries taste?)

French fries were fried in one of three different oils, and each week individuals had to assess six batches of french fries (all three oils, replicated twice)

<p style="color:white">Using the `tidyverse`,</p>

<li>Read in the french fry data:</li>

```{r}
ff <- read.csv("http://heike.github.io/rwrks/03-r-format/data/frenchfries.csv")
