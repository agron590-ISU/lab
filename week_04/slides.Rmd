# Lab 3.5 - MOAR SQL

## Commands you may need

- **Aggregate functions:** can be used in the select query to summarise results.
    - `select count(1) ...` counts the number of rows in the result set
    - `select sum(var) ...` sums value of `var` for rows in the result
    - `select max(var) ...` returns max of `var` for rows in the result
- **Group by:** returns one row for each group. For each group, you can apply an aggregate function.  
    `select group, aggregate(variable) ... group by group`
- **Distinct:** allows you to remove the duplicate rows in the result set.  
    `select distinct columns ...`

## Subqueries

A subquery is a SELECT statement nested in another statement.

```sql
select trackid,
       name,
       albumid
from track
where albumid = (
                     select albumid
                     from album
                     where title = 'Nevermind'
                 );
```

Here, `select albumid from album where title = 'Nevermind'` is the subquery that lets us grab the albumid for Nirvana's Nevermind album.
